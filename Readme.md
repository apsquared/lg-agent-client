## PYTHON AI AGENT CLIENT

This is a Python client for the AI Agent API.  It is based on the code from [this repo](https://github.com/JoshuaC215/agent-service-toolkit), which I am tweaking to work for non-chat agents.

The agents this client is being tested with can be [found here](https://github.com/apsquared/lg-agents).
